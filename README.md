# Welcome to a Official Sprite Collection
This repository is only used to make searching for official items easier from certain servers.

It contains extracted and decoded .lub files from official RO Servers.
Pre-packed with sprite and texture files from each server can be found here:

Note:
As I'm still missing entries in the itemInfo_EN.lua file, there might still be a lot missing.
<br />Also I was unable to add the following items, because I didn't find any sprites for it in any of my sources or there were no ```identifiedResourceName``` in the iteminfo.lua or id2numresnametable.txt file:
| ID  | Item Name | File Name

# Welcome to a Official Sprite Collection
This repository is only used to make searching for official items easier from certain servers.

It contains extracted and decoded .lub files from official RO Servers.
Pre-packed with sprite and texture files from each server can be found here:
 * [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/1parcvp5o9n5m/RoResourceCollection)

As of 12th January 2023, I will only update the merged GRF (officials-data.grf), as it lessens the time "wasted" updating those GRF's.

Here is a merged GRF of all sprite and texture files from each server above:
 * [Merged GRF](https://www.mediafire.com/file/mc8y1swq8sgypcd/officials-data.rar/file)
 
Here is a basic version of the merged GRF, which only has missing sprites based on kRO's data.grf present:

Note:
As I'm still missing entries in the itemInfo_EN.lua file, there might still be a lot missing.
<br />Also I was unable to add the following items, because I didn't find any sprites for it in any of my sources or there were no ```identifiedResourceName``` in the iteminfo.lua or id2numresnametable.txt file:
| ID  | Item Name | File Name 
| --- | --- | --- 
| 2361 | Blue Robe | ```파란아오자이```

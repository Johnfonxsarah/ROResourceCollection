This folder will only contain the files with the output of my lua code,
which checks for missing entries and arguments(items and quests for kRO only).
Be aware that those entries might not be ready to use, because of syntax errors,
which might occur while these files are generated.

I just wanted to share my files, in case someone wants to assist me for the translation project.

Note: You will not see my files containing the lua code, unless I stop with the project and someone wants to take over.
Also anybody with basic knowledge about lua coding can easily do it anyway.
